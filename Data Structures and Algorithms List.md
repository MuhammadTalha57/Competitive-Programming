# Math

## 1. Binary Exponentiation
> Time Complexity = O(log b), Space Complexity = O(1)

## 2. Modular Arithmetic

# Bit Manipulation

## 1. Gray Code
> Time Complexity = O(1), Space Complexity = O(1)

## 2. Inverse Gray Code
> Time Complexity O(1), Space Complexity = O(1)

# Tree

## 1. Segment Tree
> Range Operations in logarithmic time, Requires linear memory
> Can be used for higher dimensions as well such as Matrix
